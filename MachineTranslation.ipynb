    "### How much effort is put into data preparation vs. actually training and evaluating the model?\n",
    "In the the tutorial that we followed, not too much effort was put into data preparation. Most of the effort was simply lowercasing, removing punctuation, removing non-printable characters, and removing numbers. We could do a lot more of data preparation by trying to lemmatize/stem, finding POS tags, getting the dependency parsing, and more. Training and evaluating the model takes the bulk of the effort in this tutorial, as we need to worry about how to create the model and using the BLEU score to evaluate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What constitutes the input features? What constitutes the top layer?\n",
    "The input features are made up of tokenized German words. Each word in an example is converted into an arbitrary list of numbers by the Keras Tokenizer. The output is also a list of tokenized words, but these words are in English and then they are also one-hot encoded so they work with the softmax in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What does it mean that this is a \"generative\" classifier? How is that different from a discriminative classifier?\n",
    "A generative classifier creates output based on both the input data and the previous outputs of the model. This is necessary for our LSTM because it has to generate word w based on word w-1, which it also predicted. A discriminative classifer generates output only based on the input data, and \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you know your model works? What does a BLEU metric tell you? Can you think of a better way to evaluate MT output?\n",
    "I know that my model works based on the BLEU metrics. This metric tells me how closely the predicted translation matches the target translation. This is not an exact match score, but it gives credit for a translation that is mostly the same. The higher the BLEU score, the better the predicted translation matches the target translation. There are different BLEU metrics for the different n-grams (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, etc). "
